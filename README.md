# NCPRO helper method
## Description
These python script are helper method that I wrote for NC pandemic recoverable office.
The detailed description of the method is in the word ReadMe file, and comments are also inside each script.

We started the project for the intention of saving more time of audit team. Thus, the key concept of them are easy to use, read, and have as less input as possible.
Most of the time is used for carefully designing the code to suit the best need of them. The code are relatively simple and I am not in charge of the GUI system.
